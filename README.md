# API

This folder contains previous work done on using APIs, including accessing, authorising, creating enviromen variables (.env files), importing .env files and API keys, connceting to and retrieving data.

I use the OpenWeather API to obtain current and historical weather data on chosen location generating the coordinates. I set up an OpenWeather account, created a Environment variable for the API key, imported the key into Jupyter Notebook, and generated a simple request to ensure I can correcly make an API call. I then obtained coordinates of chosen locations and retrieved the weather data for these locations between the years of 1983 and 2023 and compared the results.
